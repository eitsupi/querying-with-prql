# Introduction

This document is an attempt to do some typical table data manipulation
using [PRQL](https://prql-lang.org/) and [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/).

PRQL is a in development modern language for data manipulation, and can be compiled to SQL.
DuckDB is a modern in-memory SQL OLAP ([very fast](https://duckdblabs.github.io/db-benchmark/))
database management system.

## Motivation

CLI, JavaScript, Python, R, etc., we can combine PRQL compiler and DuckDB in various places
to manipulate data with PRQL.

At the same time, new features are being added to DuckDB's SQL on a constant basis,
and the syntax is becoming more friendly.

So, I thought that by comparing PRQL and the latest DuckDB SQL (and other query libraries),
we could clarify the missing features of the PRQL and highlight the latest features of DuckDB.

## Content and Credit

The content of each data manipulation is based on
the awesome [Modern Polars](https://kevinheavey.github.io/modern-polars/) book
by [Kevin Heavey](https://github.com/kevinheavey).
And furthermore its origin is [Modern Pandas](https://tomaugspurger.github.io/posts/modern-1-intro/)
by [Tom Augsburger](https://github.com/TomAugspurger).

Each query is side-by-side with that of the original
[Python Polars](https://pola-rs.github.io/polars/py-polars/html/reference/) one
and the equivalent operations in PRQL, DuckDB SQL, and [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) (R).

Since this document focuses on the differences between the grammars of the different languages
and does not go into detail about the processing details,
I suggest that you also check out the original excellent artcles and book.

Since Quarto cannot mix knitr and jupyter engines in a single qmd file (also if using include shortcode),
the knitr document wll output to a separate md file and imported here using the Docusaurus mdx functionality.

## Running the Code on IPython

As mentioned above, PRQL and DuckDB can run on a variety of languages.
This section describes, as an example, the use of IPython for easy interactive execution of PRQL, SQL, and Polars.

### Setup

This command installs the necessary Python packages.

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
python -m pip install pyprql polars[pyarrow]
```

Then, we can start `ipython`.

Run `load_ext` magic to activate PRQL magic (from [pyprql](https://pyprql.readthedocs.io/))
and SQL magic (from [jupysql](https://jupysql.ploomber.io/)).

```{python}
#| output: false
%load_ext pyprql.magic
%load_ext sql
```

```{python}
#| include: false
%config SqlMagic.displaycon = False
%config SqlMagic.feedback = False
```

Use SQL magic connects to DuckDB in-memory database.
Note that PRQL magic shares the connection with SQL magic.

```{python}
%sql duckdb://
```

### Combine DuckDB and Polars

By setting `autopolars` config, the results of PRQL and SQL executions can be converted to polars.DataFrame.

```{python}
#| output: false
%config PrqlMagic.autopolars = True
%config SqlMagic.autopolars = True
```

Also, since DuckDB can execute queries against polars.DataFrame and polars.LazyFrame etc.,
these can be referenced directly from PRQL or SQL, as shown below.

```{python}
import polars as pl

lf = pl.LazyFrame({"a": list(range(1, 6))})
```

:::{.panel-tabset}

#### PRQL DuckDB

```{python}
%%prql
from lf
derive b = a * 5
take 3
```

#### SQL DuckDB

```{python}
%%sql
SELECT
  a,
  a * 5 AS b
FROM lf
LIMIT 3
```

#### Python Polars

```{python}
lf.with_columns(b=pl.col("a") * 5).head(3).collect()
```
