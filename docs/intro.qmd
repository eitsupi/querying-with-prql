# Introduction

This document is an attempt to do some typical table data manipulation
using [PRQL](https://prql-lang.org/) and [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/).

The content of each data manipulation is based on
the awesome [Modern Polars](https://kevinheavey.github.io/modern-polars/) book
by [Kevin Heavey](https://github.com/kevinheavey).
And furthermore its origin is [Modern Pandas](https://tomaugspurger.github.io/posts/modern-1-intro/)
by [Tom Augsburger](https://github.com/TomAugspurger).

Each query is side-by-side with that of the original Polars one
and the equivalent operations in PRQL, DuckDB SQL, and [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) (R).

Since this document focuses on the differences between the grammars of the different languages
and does not go into detail about the processing details,
I suggest that you also check out the original excellent artcles and book.

An unreleased version of DuckDB is used at this time and queries may contain features
that are not available in the released version.
The versions we are currently using are as follows:

- PRQL: `r prqlr::prql_version()`
- DuckDB: `r duckdb::sql("select version()")[1, 1]`
